# 0x04. Files Manager

## Project Overview
The **Files Manager** project is a backend application designed to facilitate file management functions. It was developed as part of the backend class, with a focus on technologies such as JavaScript, ES6, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Redis, and Kue.

**Team Members:**
- Aya Anwar
- Hagar Samy

## Project Goals
The goal of this project is to create a simple platform for uploading and viewing files with the following functionality:

- Authenticate the user via a token
- List all uploaded files
- Upload new files
- Change file permissions
- View files
- Generate image thumbnails

This project will walk you through the implementation step-by-step, while allowing some flexibility in how you organize your code (e.g., splitting it into multiple files). Using the "utils" folder may be useful for this purpose.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project we will have learned:

- How to create an API using Express
- How to authenticate a user
- How to store data in MongoDB
- How to store temporary data in Redis
- How to set up and use a background worker
